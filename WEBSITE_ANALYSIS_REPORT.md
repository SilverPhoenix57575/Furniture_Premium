## Technical Debt & Code Quality

### Issues Identified
1. **Hardcoded Data**: All content uses mock data
2. **No Error Boundaries**: Missing React error boundaries
3. **No Loading States**: Missing loading indicators for async operations
4. **Limited Accessibility**: Could improve ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
5. **No Testing**: No unit or integration tests present

### Recommendations
1. Implement proper error handling throughout the application
2. Add loading states for all async operations
3. Improve accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
4. Add comprehensive testing suite
5. Implement proper logging and monitoring

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Backend (2-3 weeks)
1. Implement database models and seed data
2. Create product and collection APIs
3. Set up form submission endpoints
4. Configure email notifications

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (2-3 weeks)
1. Add search functionality
2. Implement user accounts and persistent wishlist
3. Add product reviews and ratings
4. Improve mobile experience

### Phase 3: Optimization & Polish (1-2 weeks)

1. Admin dashboard
2. Payment integration
3. Inventory management
4. Advanced analytics

## Conclusion

The Pankaj Furniture website has a solid foundation with excellent frontend implementation and design. The primary focus should be on implementing the backend functionality to make the forms and data management work properly. The codebase is well-structured and follows modern React best practices, making it ready for production deployment once the backend integration is complete.

The most critical missing piece is the backend API implementation and email functionality, which would transform this from a static showcase into a fully functional business website.
